# Filesystem Routing

Vite-pages generates page routes based on your project file structure (filesystem routing).

## Basic Filesystem Routing Convention

The basic filesystem routing convention is very intuitive. It works out of the box and doesn't need any config. It should satisfy most users' needs.

**You can create a page by simply creating a file**: `page-name$.tsx`. Notice the `$` **at the end of the filename**. Vite-pages recognizes it and know it is a page entry.

If the filename is `index$.tsx`, the page route path will be the path of the directory. See examples below.
